### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello, I'm Nadav, a technically experienced and practice-oriented 'full stack' Data Analyst/Scientist with a passion for creating meaningful insights from data. With a background in Audience Creation, Campaign Monitoring, and HR analysis, I have leveraged my expertise in predictive and descriptive statistical and ML models to drive data-informed decision-making.

Beyond my analytical skills, I possess a unique blend of qualitative and quantitative research expertise, allowing me to gather comprehensive insights and work directly with stakeholders and clients. I have successfully developed data tools and interactive dashboards that empower users to explore and extract valuable information from complex datasets.

In addition to my professional endeavors, I also have a creative side. As an H.P. Lovecraft fan and a card collector, I find inspiration in the mysterious and surreal. I'm also a dedicated history buff, having had the incredible opportunity to work in a historical museum, where I immersed myself in the stories of the past. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also enhance my ability to think creatively and approach problem-solving from different perspectives.
